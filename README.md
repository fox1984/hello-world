// I am so excited to have a place to store my programs and give people an opportunity to view and use my programs.
<br> // My current experience programming is mostly C++ programs. 
<br> // I am a big fan of modular, structured programming, but I also wish to branch out and experiment with python.  
<br> // So my main contributions here shall be small to medium sized C++ programs and simple python // scripts to start.
